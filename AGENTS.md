# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: [to be filled]
* IDE and level of expertise: [to be filled]

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed.

## Coding standard

**All Java in this repository must follow the SE-EDU Java coding standard (intermediate level): <https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html>.** The rules are written out in the project skill `.claude/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md`; invoke that skill before writing, editing, or reviewing any Java here, and check the finished code against its self-check list.

This is not advisory. Any new or edited Java — main sources and tests alike — must comply: 4-space indent, lines within 120 chars, K&R braces on every conditional and loop body, explicit imports in the order `static` / `java` / `javax` / `org` / `com` / project, verb method names, boolean names that read as booleans, and a Javadoc whose first sentence begins with a verb on every class and public method.

## Testing

JUnit 5 tests live under `src/test/java/`, mirroring the main source package structure. A test class is named `<ClassName>Test` (e.g. `myriad.Parser` is tested by `src/test/java/myriad/ParserTest.java`). Run the suite with `./gradlew test`; the HTML report lands at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`.

Name test methods `featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior()`, e.g. `resolveIndex_emptyList_exceptionThrown()`.

**Coverage target: the top ~50% highest-value methods** — those carrying complex, core, or business-critical logic. Console formatting (`Ui`) and thin I/O wrappers are deliberately out of scope; their behaviour is covered by the scripted transcript checker in `claude-test/`.

**JUnit tests must be updated in the same change as any code change, so the suite stays at that target.** Adding a branch means adding a case for it; changing an error message, a date format, or the save format means updating the assertions that pin it down. A change that leaves the suite passing only because nothing tests the new code has not met the target.

Where a test documents a known defect rather than intended behaviour, assert what the code currently does and mark it with a `// Known limitation:` comment explaining the cause — so the test is not later "fixed" by loosening it.

Note that `junit-jupiter-params` is not on the classpath, so `@ParameterizedTest` is unavailable; use a plain `@Test` with a loop over an array of cases instead.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
