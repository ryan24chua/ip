/**
 * Entry point for the Myriad chatbot.
 * Loads any saved tasks from disk, greets the user, then reads lines of
 * input, each treated as a command (adding, listing, marking, deleting and
 * searching tasks), until the user types {@code bye} or the input runs out,
 * then says goodbye. A line that doesn't match any known command, or that's
 * missing a required argument, throws a {@link MyriadException}, which is
 * caught once per line in {@link #executeLine} and shown as an error.
 *
 * One chatbot session is one {@code Myriad} object: it holds the pieces
 * that session needs — the {@link Ui} it talks through, the {@link Storage}
 * it saves to, and the {@link TaskList} it works on — and hands all three to
 * each {@link Command} it runs. Working out what a line means is the
 * {@link Parser}'s job and carrying it out is the {@code Command}'s, so this
 * class is left with the wiring: set the three up, then feed lines through
 * them.
